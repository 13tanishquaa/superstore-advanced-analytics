# Superstore Advanced Analytics

## 1. Business Problem & Context

This project simulates a real-world retail analytics engagement for a large Superstore
operating across multiple regions, product categories, and customer segments.

Although overall sales have been increasing, the business is experiencing declining
or stagnant profitability. Leadership suspects that inefficient discount strategies,
poor inventory planning, and lack of customer-level insights are eroding margins.

Currently, decisions related to pricing, promotions, inventory, and marketing are made
reactively, with limited predictive or customer-centric analytics.

## 2. Executive-Level Challenges

From a leadership perspective, the business faces the following challenges:

1. Profit is declining despite sales growth, with limited visibility into root causes.
2. Inventory overstocking and understocking are increasing operational costs and lost sales.
3. Customers are treated uniformly, with no clear understanding of loyalty or lifetime value.
4. Discounts are applied broadly without understanding their true impact on demand and profit.
5. The organization lacks an executive-level dashboard for decision-ready insights.

## 3. Business Questions to Analytics Mapping

| Business Question | Analytics Question | Project Phase |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Why is profit declining? | Which products, regions, and discounts drive negative margins? | EDA, Statistical Analysis |
| How much inventory should we stock? | Can future demand be forecasted accurately? | Sales Forecasting |
| Who are our best customers? | How can customers be segmented by value and behavior? | Customer Segmentation |
| Which customers are at risk of leaving? | Can churn probability be predicted? | Churn Prediction |
| How do we increase revenue per customer? | Can we recommend relevant products? | Recommendation System |
| Are discounts actually profitable? | What discount levels maximize profit? | Profit Optimization |

## 4. Key Business KPIs

The project evaluates success using business-aligned metrics:

- Total Sales Revenue
- Total Profit and Profit Margin
- Discount Rate and Discount Effectiveness
- Customer Lifetime Value (historical proxy)
- Customer Churn Rate
- Demand Forecast Error (translated into inventory impact)
- Revenue and Profit Contribution by Segment

## 5. Decisions Enabled by This Project

This project enables leadership to make data-driven decisions such as:

- Reducing or restructuring discounts on low-margin products
- Prioritizing high-value customer segments for retention campaigns
- Optimizing inventory levels to reduce stockouts and excess inventory
- Deploying proactive churn prevention strategies
- Increasing average order value through product recommendations

## 6. Analytics Roadmap

The project follows an end-to-end analytics lifecycle aligned with real-world practice:

- Exploratory Data Analysis → Identify revenue and profit leaks
- Data Preprocessing → Production-ready data pipelines
- Feature Engineering → Business-driven signals
- Statistical Analysis → Hypothesis validation
- Sales Forecasting → Inventory planning
- Customer Segmentation → Marketing strategy
- Churn Prediction → Retention optimization
- Product Recommendation → Upsell and cross-sell
- Profit Optimization → Pricing and discount strategy
- Executive Dashboard → Decision-ready insights

## 7. Success Criteria & Risks

Success Criteria:
- Clear identification of profit-draining behaviors
- Statistically validated insights
- Interpretable predictive models
- Actionable recommendations tied to business decisions
- Executive-friendly dashboard

Assumptions and Risks:
- Historical data reflects future behavior
- Churn must be inferred due to lack of explicit labels
- External factors (competition, seasonality) are not fully captured
